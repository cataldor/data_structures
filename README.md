This is a collection of data structures implemented in C.

Our gol is to progressively add data structures with the most common algorithms
(e.g., insertion, deletion, searching and friends talking about binary trees)
and later providing more fancy operations on them.

Goal: being pedagogical for newcomers and maybe also being useful for interviews.
